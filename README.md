This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Things I would improve

Due to the times I couldn't do everything I wanted so these are the things I would improve:

1.Use interfaces everywhere instead of using any
2.Organize and arrange the code more
3.Add the DND option
